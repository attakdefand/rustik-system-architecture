1.  **Shortening Process:**
    *   User submits long URL via REST API (\`POST /shorten\`).
    *   App Node generates a unique short code (e.g., 6-8 alphanumeric chars via Base62 encoding of a distributed counter, or hashing).
    *   Store \`{short_code: long_URL}\` mapping in a Key-Value DB (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
    *   Optionally handle custom aliases, check availability.
    *   Return short URL (e.g., \`https://your.domain/short_code\`).

2.  **Redirection Process:**
    *   User accesses \`https://your.domain/short_code\`.
    *   Request hits Load Balancers, routed to redirector services (optimized Rust App Nodes).
    *   Redirector checks in-memory cache (LRU) -> distributed cache (Redis) -> primary Key-Value DB for \`long_URL\`.
    *   Issues HTTP 301 (Permanent) or 302 (Temporary) redirect.
    *   Cache \`long_URL\` at various levels.

3.  **Analytics Tracking:**
    *   Asynchronously log click events (e.g., \`short_code\`, \`timestamp\`) for each redirection to a message queue (e.g., Kafka, SQS).
    *   Separate analytics service consumes events, aggregates counts, stores in a data warehouse or relational DB.
    *   API endpoint (\`GET /stats/{short_code}\`) provides click counts.

Core Idea: Decouple post creation from feed generation. Hybrid push (fan-out-on-write) and pull (fan-out-on-load) models.

1.  **Services (Microservices Architecture):**
    *   **User Service:** Manages user accounts, profiles, auth. (Relational DB or Graph DB)
    *   **Post Service:** Handles post creation, storage (e.g., NoSQL like Cassandra), retrieval. Publishes new post events to Message Queue (e.g., Kafka).
    *   **Follow Service:** Manages user follow relationships. (Graph DB or Relational DB)
    *   **Feed Generation Service (or Worker Pool):**
        *   **Fan-out on Write (Push):** Consumes new post events. For each post, retrieves author's followers. Injects post (or reference) into each follower's feed/timeline (e.g., Redis Sorted Set keyed by user ID). Good for active users.
        *   **Fan-out on Load (Pull):** For less active users or cold starts, service queries Post Service for recent posts from followed users, aggregates, ranks, and returns.
    *   **Media Service:** Handles image/video uploads (to Object Storage like S3), processing (thumbnails, transcoding), and provides CDN URLs.
    *   **Interaction Service:** Handles likes, comments. Updates counts (e.g., in Redis, then flushed to persistent DB). Publishes events for notifications.
    *   **Notification Service:** Generates notifications for likes, comments, new posts.

2.  **Feed Generation & Delivery:**
    *   **Writing a Post:** Client -> API Gateway -> Post Service. Post stored, event published to Kafka.
    *   **Reading Feed:** Client -> API Gateway -> Feed Service (or directly to Redis cache).
        *   If pre-computed (fan-out-on-write): Retrieve user's timeline from Redis.
        *   If on-demand (fan-out-on-load): Aggregate posts from followed users.
    *   **Ranking:** Algorithm (chronological, engagement, ML-personalized) sorts posts. Can happen during pre-computation or on-demand.
    *   **Caching:** User timelines, post content, user profiles heavily cached. CDNs serve media.

3.  **Real-time Updates (Optional):**
    *   WebSocket connections from clients to a Real-time Service. New posts/interactions pushed to update client view.

1.  **Services (Microservices Architecture):**
    *   **Rider Service:** Manages rider profiles, ride requests, payment methods.
    *   **Driver Service:** Manages driver profiles, availability status, vehicle details, payouts.
    *   **Location Service:** Ingests and processes real-time location updates from drivers (e.g., via WebSockets or frequent HTTP posts). Stores current locations in a geo-indexed database (e.g., Redis Geo or PostGIS). Provides querying capabilities for nearby drivers.
    *   **Matching Service:** Receives ride requests. Queries Location Service for nearby available drivers. Applies matching algorithms (considering proximity, driver rating, vehicle type, etc.). Notifies selected driver(s).
    *   **Trip Service:** Manages the lifecycle of a ride (requested, accepted, ongoing, completed, canceled). Stores ride history.
    *   **Payment Service:** Integrates with payment gateways to process ride payments and driver payouts.
    *   **Notification Service:** Sends real-time push notifications to riders/drivers (e.g., ride accepted, driver arriving, new ride request).

2.  **Core Flows:**
    *   **Driver Availability & Location Update:** Drivers' apps periodically send location updates and availability status to the Location Service.
    *   **Rider Requests Ride:** Rider app sends pickup/dropoff locations to Rider Service, which forwards to Matching Service.
    *   **Driver Matching:** Matching Service queries Location Service for nearby drivers. Algorithm selects best match(es). Request sent to driver(s) via Notification Service.
    *   **Ride Accepted:** Driver accepts. Trip Service updates ride status. Rider and Driver are connected for location sharing/communication.
    *   **During Ride:** Location Service tracks both. ETAs updated.
    *   **Ride Completion & Payment:** Trip Service marks ride complete. Payment Service processes payment. Ratings collected.

3.  **Data Storage:**
    *   Relational DB for user profiles, ride history, payment transactions.
    *   Geo-indexed DB/cache (Redis Geo, PostGIS) for real-time driver locations and availability.

4.  **Communication:**
    *   Mobile clients (Rider/Driver apps) communicate with backend via API Gateway (REST/GraphQL).
    *   Real-time location updates/notifications use WebSockets or efficient polling.
    *   Internal services communicate via gRPC or asynchronous messages (Kafka).

    ],
    conceptualSolutionOutline: `
1.  **Core Logic (Algorithms):**
    *   **Token Bucket:** Each client has a bucket of tokens that refills at a fixed rate. Each request consumes a token. If no tokens, request is rejected.
    *   **Leaky Bucket:** Requests are added to a queue (bucket). If the queue is full, requests are rejected. Requests leak out of the bucket at a constant rate.
    *   **Fixed Window Counter:** Count requests within a fixed time window (e.g., last minute). Reset count at the end of window. Prone to burst traffic at window edges.
    *   **Sliding Window Log:** Store timestamps of requests in a sorted set/list. Count requests within the current sliding window. More accurate, higher storage/computation.
    *   **Sliding Window Counter:** Hybrid approach. Combines fixed window efficiency with sliding window accuracy using weighted counts from current and previous windows.

2.  **Storage for Counters/State:**
    *   **Distributed Cache (Redis):** Highly suitable due to its speed, atomic increment operations (INCR, INCRBY), and features like sorted sets (for sliding window log) or Lua scripting for complex logic. Keys could be \`rate_limit:{client_id}:{api_endpoint}\`.
    *   **In-memory (with care):** For very localized rate limiting if distribution isn't a concern (rare for scalable systems).

3.  **Implementation Strategy:**
    *   **Middleware:** Implement as middleware in your application framework or API gateway.
    *   **Dedicated Service:** A separate rate limiting microservice that other services query.
    *   **API Gateway Integration:** Many modern API Gateways (e.g., Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway) have built-in rate limiting capabilities.

4.  **Enforcement:**
    *   Before processing a request, check the rate limit for the client.
    *   If limit exceeded, return HTTP 429 with headers like \`Retry-After\`, \`X-RateLimit-Limit\`, \`X-RateLimit-Remaining\`, \`X-RateLimit-Reset\`.
    *   If within limits, process the request and update the counter.

5.  **Distributed Systems:**
    *   Counters must be shared and synchronized across all instances handling requests for a client. This is why Redis (or similar) is crucial.
    *   Race conditions can occur; atomic operations are key. Eventual consistency might be acceptable for some less strict scenarios.

    actions: [
      "Break down the monolith into Microservices, focusing on high-load or complex business domains first.",
      "Introduce an API Gateway to manage and route requests to microservices.",
      "Utilize Message Queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing and inter-service communication.",
      "Adopt more advanced Database Strategies (e.g., NoSQL for specific use cases like user sessions or product catalogs, potential database sharding if relational DBs hit limits).",
      "Implement robust Observability: comprehensive metrics, distributed tracing, and centralized logging.",
      "Automate deployments with CI/CD pipelines for reliable and frequent releases.",
      "Strengthen Security Architecture with dedicated security components and practices.",
      "Implement Autoscaling for various layers (app servers, microservices, database capacity).",
    ],
    pros: [
      "Independent scaling of services based on demand.",
      "Improved fault isolation â€“ failure in one service is less likely to affect others.",
      "Technology diversity: different services can use different tech stacks if beneficial.",
      "Smaller, more focused teams can manage individual services.",
    ],
    challenges: [
      "Increased complexity of a distributed system (network latency, inter-service communication).",
      "Higher operational overhead (managing many services).",
      "Requires mature DevOps practices.",
      "Data consistency across services can be complex (eventual consistency, sagas).",
