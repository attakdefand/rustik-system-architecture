## Future Enhancements (Potential Ideas)

Here are some advanced directions Rustik could explore in the future to become an even more powerful tool for architectural design and operations:

*   **Collaboration & Versioning**:
    Add real-time multi-user editing with change history so teams can co-design, comment on, and roll back architectural changes—just like a Google Doc for infra diagrams.
    *   **A Robust Backend System**: We'd need a backend to handle user authentication, manage real-time data synchronization (e.g., using WebSockets), and store the architectural designs, their versions, and comments in a database.
    *   **Real-time Collaboration Logic**: Technologies like Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) or operational transforms would likely be needed to manage simultaneous edits from multiple users smoothly.
    *   **Significant UI/UX Overhaul**: The current interface would need to be substantially redesigned to incorporate editing tools, comment threads, version history viewers, etc.
    *   **Database Integration**: A database (SQL or NoSQL) would be essential for persisting all this collaborative data.
*   **Diagram Export & Codegen**:
    Enable one-click exports to PlantUML/C4 notation, SVG/PNG, or even Terraform/CloudFormation stubs so your conceptual designs can flow straight into IaC pipelines.
*   **Cost & Performance Simulation**:
    Integrate cloud-provider APIs (AWS, GCP, Azure) to attach real cost estimates and latency profiles to each component, then run “what-if” scenarios to forecast budget vs. performance trade-offs.
*   **Security Posture Assessment (Advanced)**:
    Build in a rule-based or AI-powered security auditor that flags missing mTLS, weak isolation zones, or single points of failure—turning your visual model into a living threat-model. (Beyond the current conceptual analysis).
*   **Plugin & API Ecosystem**:
    Expose a plugin framework or REST API so the community (or your own teams) can add new component libraries, custom AI flows (e.g. compliance checks), or embed Rustik analyses in other tooling.
*   **Saved Profiles & Templates**:
    Offer templates for common patterns (e.g. “Global CDN + Multi-Region DB”) and let users snapshot and share “best practice” configurations across projects or orgs. This would likely require user accounts.
*   **Alerting & Drift Detection**:
    If you connect your visual models to live infrastructure (via metrics or Terraform state), detect and notify when real-world topology drifts away from the designed architecture or exhibits unusual behavior.
*   **CI/CD Integration (Advanced)**:
    Plug Rustik into your pipeline: break the build if your IaC deviates from approved architectural patterns, or auto-generate compliance reports on every PR.
*   **AI-Driven Architectural Pattern Recommendation Engine**: Users describe a high-level problem or goal, and the AI suggests suitable architectural components and patterns.
*   **Conceptual Scalability Simulation / "What-if" Scenarios (Advanced)**: AI analyzes how a selected architecture might conceptually respond to different load levels or failure scenarios in more detail.
*   **Automated Conceptual Architectural Document Generation**: AI generates a more comprehensive high-level architectural design document (Markdown) based on user selections and analysis results.
*   **Digital Twin & “What-If” Simulator**:
    Spin up a sandboxed, code-generated replica of your design (e.g. in Docker or Kubernetes) and run synthetic load tests to validate performance and failure modes before you build.
    *   **Advanced Code Generation**: Would require sophisticated capabilities to generate functional code for various components and their interactions based on user selections.
    *   **Infrastructure Orchestration Integration**: Needs to interface with tools like Docker or Kubernetes to dynamically create and manage sandboxed environments.
    *   **Load Testing Framework Integration**: Would need to integrate with synthetic load testing tools to apply workloads to the simulated environment.
    *   **Performance Monitoring in Sandbox**: Requires mechanisms to collect, aggregate, and analyze performance metrics from the temporary "digital twin."
*   **Policy-as-Code Enforcement**:
    Define organizational rules (e.g. “all traffic between regions must use mTLS” or “no single-AZ database”) in a declarative language, then block or flag any design that violates them.
*   **Adaptive Blueprint Optimization**:
    Use reinforcement-learning or genetic-algorithms to evolve your design automatically based on cost, latency, and resilience objectives—letting the AI propose “next-generation” topologies.
*   **ChatOps & Collaboration Bots**:
    Integrate with Slack/Teams so you can “@rustik analyze this config” or get architecture change notifications in your dev channels.
*   **User Accounts & Saved Configurations**: Allow users to create accounts, save their architectural explorations, and revisit them later. (Note: This would require significant backend changes).
*   **Interactive Diagram Rendering in Visualizer**: Dynamically generate a visual (graphical) diagram of selected components and their conceptual connections. (Note: Requires a client-side diagramming library).

## Cloning and Running Locally

To clone and run Rustik on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project.
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE> rustik-app
    cd rustik-app
    ```
    Replace `<YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE>` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the project dependencies using either npm or yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    The application uses Genkit, which connects to Google AI models (like Gemini) for its AI-powered features. You'll need a Google AI API key.
    *   Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project (i.e., inside the `rustik-app` folder).
    *   Add your Google AI API key to this `.env` file. The content should look like this:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
        ```
        Replace `your_google_ai_api_key_here` with your actual API key.
    *   You can obtain a Google AI API key by visiting [Google AI Studio (formerly MakerSuite)](https://aistudio.google.com/). Create a new API key if you don't have one.

4.  **Run the Development Servers**:
    Rustik requires two development servers to run concurrently:
    *   One for the Next.js frontend application.
    *   One for the Genkit AI flows (which act as the backend for AI features).

    You will need to open **two separate terminal windows** or tabs for these commands.

    *   **Terminal 1: Start the Genkit Development Server**:
        In your first terminal window, navigate to the project directory (`rustik-app`) and run:
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        This command starts the Genkit development server. It will typically run on port `3400` (e.g., `http://localhost:3400`). This server handles the AI flow executions. It will also automatically recompile your flows if you make changes to them in the `src/ai/flows/` directory.

    *   **Terminal 2: Start the Next.js Development Server**:
        In your second terminal window, navigate to the project directory (`rustik-app`) and run:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        This command starts the Next.js frontend application. It will typically run on port `9002` (e.g., `http://localhost:9002`).

5.  **Access the Application**:
    Once both servers are running:
    *   Open your web browser.
    *   Navigate to `http://localhost:9002` (or the port specified in your terminal output for the Next.js server).

    You should now be able to use the Rustik application, including its AI-powered analysis features.

## Automated Workflows with GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate several quality checks and can be extended for more advanced CI/CD capabilities:

*   **Linting and Type Checking**: Automatically checks your code for style issues (ESLint) and type errors (TypeScript) on every push or pull request. This helps catch common mistakes early. (See: `.github/workflows/lint-typecheck.yml`)
*   **Build Check**: Ensures your Next.js application successfully builds whenever changes are made. This prevents merging code that breaks the production build. (See: `.github/workflows/build-check.yml`)
    *   **Note on Build Check**: The build process might require a `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. For CI, you can set a dummy key as a GitHub repository secret named `DUMMY_GOOGLE_API_KEY_FOR_BUILD`. If the build doesn't require it, this can be omitted from the workflow file.
*   **Automated Testing (Conceptual)**: A conceptual workflow is set up to run unit tests (`npm test`). This would need actual tests to be written and the `package.json` `test` script to be configured. (See: `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml`)
*   **Security Scanning (SAST - Conceptual)**: A workflow using GitHub CodeQL is set up to perform Static Analysis Security Testing. Results appear in the "Security" tab of your repository. (See: `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`)
*   **Automated Dependency Updates (Dependabot)**: Configured via `.github/dependabot.yml` to automatically check for and create PRs for npm dependency updates.

### Further GitHub Actions Capabilities (Potential Future Setup)

*   **Comprehensive Automated Testing**:
    *   **Unit Tests**: Expand on the conceptual setup by writing tests (e.g., with Jest or Vitest) and ensuring the `npm test` script executes them.
    *   **Integration Tests**: For testing how different parts of your application interact.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Using tools like Cypress or Playwright, you can automate browser interactions to test user flows. This is very powerful for catching regressions in the UI and overall application behavior.
*   **Deployment Automation (CI/CD)**:
    *   **Deploy to Staging/Preview**: Automatically deploy your application to a staging or preview environment (like Vercel, Netlify, Firebase App Hosting, or your own cloud infrastructure) whenever you push to a specific branch (e.g., `develop` or feature branches).
    *   **Deploy to Production**: Set up a workflow to deploy to your production environment when you merge to `main` or create a release tag. This often includes steps like building the optimized production version of your app.
*   **Code Coverage Reporting**:
    *   After running tests, you can have a workflow that calculates code coverage (what percentage of your code is covered by tests) and uploads the report (e.g., to Codecov or Coveralls).
*   **Release Management**:
    *   Automate the process of creating release notes, tagging releases, and publishing packages (if your project becomes a library).

We hope you find Rustik insightful for exploring the fascinating world of hyperscale system architecture!
